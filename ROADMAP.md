## Database Management

### Database Migrations Strategy
FieldMaster uses Django's built-in migration system to manage database schema changes.

- **Creating Migrations:**
  - Run `python manage.py makemigrations` after modifying models.
- **Applying Migrations:**
  - Run `python manage.py migrate` to apply migrations to the database.
- **Rolling Back Migrations:**
  - Use `python manage.py migrate <app_name> <migration_number>` to revert to a previous migration.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Always review generated migrations before applying.
  - Test migrations on a staging environment before production.
  - For long-lived projects, periodically squash migrations to keep the migration history manageable.

### Database Backup System
Regular database backups are critical for disaster recovery.

- **Manual Backup:**
  - Use `pg_dump` to create a backup:  
    `pg_dump -U <db_user> -h <db_host> -F c -b -v -f backup_file.dump <db_name>`
- **Manual Restore:**
  - Use `pg_restore` to restore:  
    `pg_restore -U <db_user> -h <db_host> -d <db_name> -v backup_file.dump`
- **Automated Backups:**
  - Schedule daily backups using cron jobs or task scheduler.
  - Store backups offsite or in cloud storage for redundancy.
- **Testing Backups:**
  - Periodically test restoring from backups to ensure data integrity.

### Database Monitoring
Monitoring helps detect issues before they impact users.

- **Recommended Tools:**
  - [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) for database management and monitoring.
  - [pg_stat_statements](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html) for query performance.
  - External services: Datadog, New Relic, AWS RDS monitoring, etc.
- **Key Metrics to Monitor:**
  - Connection count
  - Slow queries
  - Replication lag (if applicable)
  - Disk usage
  - CPU and memory usage
- **Alerting:**
  - Set up alerts for critical issues (e.g., out-of-disk, high latency, failed backups).
- **Enabling Monitoring:**
  - Enable and configure monitoring tools in both development and production environments.
